1.  Question tagging with BERT (HuggingFace)

In instances where an individual poses a health-related query/description, there may be underlying themes linked to the question that aren't immediately apparent. In this endeavor, we employ a BERT model to identify and tag medical issues related to patient inquiries. This is achieved by leveraging extensive datasets from ehealth, icliniq, QuestionDoctorsQA, and WebMDQA websites.
